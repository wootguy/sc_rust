# Rust for Sven Co-op
These are the scripts used in the [Rust maps](http://scmapdb.com/map:rust) for Sven Co-op. These scripts depend on [weapon_custom](https://github.com/wootguy/weapon_custom) to function.

Feel free to fork this and do your translations or add features. When I release new changes you can pull from this repo and merge changes with the help of git instead of applying everything manually.

# Installation
